    <h2><a href="">Scope</a> & <a href="">Closures</a></h2>
    <p>Perhaps one of the most fundamental things you'll need to quickly come to terms with is how scoping of variables really works in JavaScript. It's not enough to have anecdotal fuzzy beliefs about scope.</p>
    <p>The <a href="">Scope</a> & <a href="">Closures</a> title starts by debunking the common <a href="">misconception</a> that JS is an "<a href="">interpreted</a> language" and therefore not compiled. Nope.</p>
    <p>The <a href="">JS engine</a> compiles your code right before (and sometimes during!) execution. So we use some <a href="">deeper</a> understanding of the <a href="">compiler's</a> approach to our code to understand how it finds and deals with variable and function declarations. Along the way, we see the typical metaphor for JS variable scope management, <a href="">"Hoisting."</a></p>
    <p>This critical understanding of <a href="">"lexical scope"</a> is what we then base our <a href="">exploration</a> of closure on for the last chapter of the book. Closure is perhaps the single <a href="">most</a>important concept in all of JS, but if you haven't first grasped firmly how scope works, closure will likely remain beyond your grasp.</p>
    <p>One important application of closure is the <a href="">module</a> pattern, as we briefly introduced in this book in Chapter 2. The module pattern is perhaps the most <a href="">prevalent</a> code organization <a href="">pattern</a> in all of JavaScript; deep understanding of it should be one of your highest priorities.</p>
