      Hello! I 💗 JavaScript
      JavaScript is awesome 👍. It's easy to learn partially, and much harder to learn completely (or even sufficiently) 💯. When developers encounter confusion, they usually blame the language 🈲 instead of their lack of understanding. These books 📚 aim to fix that, inspiring a strong appreciation for the language you can now, and should, deeply know.
      Note 📝: Many of the examples in this book assume modern (and future-reaching JavaScript engine environments, such as ES6. Some code may not work as described if run in older (pre-ES6) engines.
